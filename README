If things are getting too complicated in your current repo, I suggest just starting fresh.

1. Create a directory on your computer and name it for your project
2. Create a server directory
3. 'cd server', 'npm init -y', 'touch server.js', 'touch Dockerfile', 'touch .dockerignore'
4. Go back to the main directory ('cd ..')
5. 'npx create-expo-app client', 'cd client', 'touch Dockerfile', 'touch .dockerignore', 'rm -rf .git'
6. Go back to the main directory ('cd ..')
7. 'touch docker-compose.yml'
8. You can either copy the content of each Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml from this repo or ask GPT to make you one
    add node_modules to the .dockerignore files
    
9. Upload it to GitHub (you can do this at the end if you want) 'git init' and remote add to your repo
10. Open Docker Desktop
11. 'docker compose up --build'

You may need to install dependencies in either directory. Make sure you are doing this within the client or server directories
and not globally in your main directory.

Use .dockerignore files in each directory to make building the containers more efficient if you have resources that are not 
necessary for the Docker image. Add node_modules to the .dockerignore file.

The first time you do run 'docker compose up --build' it will probably take forever. It gets faster unless you trash the 
container then it may just take long every time.

Add environment variables to docker-compose.yml to help with connecting frontend to backend
for example 
    environment:
          - API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api

When the containers are running, you should be able to open the frontend on Expo Go and test the backend on Postman.

For an example connected frontend to backend, I created the button component (/client/components/FetchButton.tsx) and call the
endpoint URL using the environment variables in docker-compose.yml and the endpoints in (/server/server.js).
